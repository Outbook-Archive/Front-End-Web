## Introduction
Outbook is a web application which allows people to book appointments with ease. It uses the recruiter's online calendar and allows the candidate to schedule an appointment directly into their open calendar slots.

We are currently only working with Outlook, but hope to expand in time!

## Setup

- Clone/Fork the repository
- Use `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Remove "sample" from `sample.env` to get `.env` and set `REACT_APP_BACK_END_LINK` to the domain that is hosting the back end. Make sure to leave the forward slash off at the end.
